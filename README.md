# processing-karaoke
A karaoke file viewer for Processing

# Requirements
You need [Processing](https://processing.org/) for this to run.
Tested with Processing 3.3.6, others may work too.

You will also need to add some libraries:
- [Processing Video](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/video/index.html)
- [Processing Audio](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/sound/index.html)

To add those to Processing, click `Sketch > Import Library > Add Library` and search them.

# Prerequisites
Due to copyright restrictions, I'm unable to share the Karaoke files.
You can download music videos from YouTube and use Karaoke Files made for UltraStar.
Change the file locations in `Karaoke/ScreenSingingGame.pde`.

# Run
Press run in the Processing IDE.

# Errors
If you find any errors, please help me find them by opening an Issue on Github.
