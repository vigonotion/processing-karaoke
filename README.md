# processing-karaoke
A karaoke file viewer for Processing

# Preparation

## Download
If you want to run the source directly in Processing, clone this repository.
If you just want to run this, go to `releases` in GitHub and download the newest Zip file for your system.

## Prerequisites
Due to copyright restrictions, I'm unable to share the Karaoke files.
You can download music videos from YouTube and use Karaoke Files made for UltraStar.

## Settings
You will need to tweak some settings. Go to the `data/assets`-Folder and make a copy of `settings.example.ini` and rename it to `settings.ini`.
Edit the file and change `songFolder=C:\path\to\karaoke\files\` to match the folder where you store your song files. You can also edit other settings there.

# Start

## Using a release build
Just start the exe/jar file for your system.

## Compile from source
Press run in the Processing IDE.

# Errors
If you find any errors, please help me find them by opening an Issue on Github.
